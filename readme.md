# Nanner Scanner
## A Geocoding Distance Tracker Utilizing the Universal System of Measurement Commonly Referred to as *A Banana*
### By Nicola Zanghi
#### Made 10/23/20

Like the *cubit* of Egypt's great Pharoahs, Banana For Scale is a universal approach to measurement recognized and accessible to all. It is an immediate visual indicator of an object and just how impressive, minute, or gargantuan it is. The goal of this project is to apply this concept of scale visibility to the magnificence of our planet and the splendor of humanity's accomplishment in creating the ISS as it approaches its *20th* year in orbit. 

In order to accomplish what it does, The Nanner Scanner utilizes Google Maps geolocation in conjunction with the International Space Station's live GPS. 

### Getting Started
Nanner Scanner is pretty easy to use, just type in the address bar and hit the *Go Bananas* button. If you hit the button without anything, the default location is Margaritaville in Key West, Florida. 


#### As a user, you will be able to type in an address or the name of a place and find the ISS distance in bananas

#### As a user, you will NOT be able to see it in any unit of measurement other than bananas

#### As a user, you will also be able to visit a page of banana and ISS facts


## Future Updates

The Nanner Scanner's roadmap includes a few fun tweaks and quality-of-life improvements.

**Expanded Functionality** The Nanner Scanner will be updated to allow for two GPS coordinates to be placed, so you can see how far it is to your friend's house (in bananas). In addition, your web browser's geolocation will be usable as an starting parameters for the Nanner Scanner's calculations.

**More Facts** We could all use a lil more learning. More facts about both The ISS and bananas are on the way.

**More Fruits and Vegetables** Want to know the distance in potatoes? Pumpkins? Grapes? It's all possible with the basis of the Nanner Scanner's formula worked out. Maybe we can throw in some non-edible measurements, like football fields, or just footballs!

**Multiple Default Starting Addresses** Margaritaville is hopefully just the start of a fun list of places for the user's default starting address. Ideally we'll also communicate this directly to the user as opposed to having it be tucked away like it is.
